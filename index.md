## About Me

Hi! I am a first-year graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University expected to graduate in 2023 Fall. Before joining CMU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with the First Class Honours in June 2022. 

I am fortunate to work with [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) for NLP dataset characterization. My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction, LLM Application and Evaluation, and Open-domain Chatbot System.
