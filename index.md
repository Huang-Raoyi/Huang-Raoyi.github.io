## About Me

Hi! I am a first-year graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University expected to graduate in December 2023. Before joining CMU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with the First Class Honours in June 2022. 

I am fortunate to work with [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) for NLP dataset characterization. I'm a versatile AI & Software Engineer interested in developing State-of-the-Art AI Solutions for anyone to use and adapt. I have experiences in LLM application and Evaluation, Open-domain Chatbot System, and Time-series Data Prediction.



<!--- ## Research Interests --->

<!--- - **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning --->

## News
- **[Sep. 2023]** First-ever paper in adversariality accepted (at IJCNLP-AACL 2023)! We show NLP dataset characterization metrics are valuable for adversarial test measurements.
- **[Aug. 2023]** Started my capstone study at [Bayer](https://www.bayer.com/en/) for myRadiology360 cross-platform mobile application development.
- **[May 2023]** Started a summer internship at [HKUST VisLab](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/) working on LLM-empowered reverse engineering for visualization.
