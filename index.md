## About Me
<!-- 
Hi! I am a first-year graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University expected to graduate in December 2023. Before joining CMU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with the First Class Honours in June 2022. 

I am fortunate to work with [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) for NLP dataset characterization. I'm a versatile AI & Software Engineer interested in developing State-of-the-Art AI Solutions for anyone to use and adapt. I have experiences in LLM application and Evaluation, Open-domain Chatbot System, and Time-series Data Prediction. -->

Hello! I’m an Account Solution Architect for Auto industry dedicated to bridging technological gaps with innovative AI solutions at Amazon Web Services. My expertise spans large language model applications, conversational AI, time-series data prediction, and image generation. I'm committed to transforming complex challenges into scalable and impactful technologies. If you’re looking to push boundaries and drive significant advancements in AI, I’d love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to shape the future.
