## About Me
<!-- 
Hi! I am a first-year graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University expected to graduate in December 2023. Before joining CMU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with the First Class Honours in June 2022. 

I am fortunate to work with [Sherry Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/) for NLP dataset characterization. I'm a versatile AI & Software Engineer interested in developing State-of-the-Art AI Solutions for anyone to use and adapt. I have experiences in LLM application and Evaluation, Open-domain Chatbot System, and Time-series Data Prediction. -->

Hello! I’m an Account Solution Architect at Amazon Web Services, dedicated to bridging technological gaps with innovative AI solutions. <br> 

My expertise spans large language model applications, conversational AI, time-series data prediction, and image generation. Committed to facilitating digital transformation, I aim to seamlessly integrate AI technologies within industry practices, enhancing efficiency and innovation. <br>

If you’re interested in leveraging AI to transform your business operations, I’d love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to achieve your goals.
